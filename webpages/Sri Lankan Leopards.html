                    Udawalawe National Park, with its open grasslands and sprawling

                    and elevated plateau in the central highlands of Sri Lanka. The open grasslands 
                    and montane forests of Horton Plains create a distinctive environment for leopards 
                    to navigate and hunt. Their presence in such diverse ecosystems highlights their 
                    ability to adapt to different climates and terrains, showcasing the adaptability of 
                    these majestic creatures.</p>

            <div id="cont44">
                <p>Habitat loss poses a significant threat to leopard populations in Sri Lanka. As human populations 
                    expand and agricultural activities intensify, the natural habitats of leopards are being fragmented 
                    and, in some cases, completely destroyed. The consequences of habitat loss are severe, leading to a 
                    reduction in the available territory for leopards to roam, hunt, and establish territories. This results 
                    in increased human-wildlife conflict as leopards may venture into human settlements in search of food.</p>

                <p>To address this threat, Sri Lanka has implemented various mechanisms, including the establishment and 
                        maintenance of national parks and wildlife reserves. These protected areas aim to preserve and restore 
                        the natural habitats crucial for leopard survival. Conservation organizations like the Sri Lanka Wildlife 
                        Conservation Society (SLWCS) actively work towards habitat restoration and community-based conservation initiatives, 
                        fostering coexistence between leopards and local communities.</p>

        <h1 >Poaching</h1>

                <p>
                    Poaching remains a significant threat to leopard populations in Sri Lanka, driven by illegal wildlife trade and the 
                    demand for leopard body parts. The consequences of poaching are dire, with a decline in leopard numbers and disruptions 
                    in the ecological balance. Leopard populations are particularly vulnerable due to their low reproductive rates, making it 
                    crucial to address poaching to ensure their long-term survival.
    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Efforts to reduce poaching include strengthened law enforcement, anti-poaching patrols, and community engagement programs. 
                    The Sri Lanka Leopard Project, a collaborative initiative involving the Department of Wildlife Conservation and other stakeholders, 
                    focuses on research and conservation to combat poaching. By raising awareness and involving local communities in leopard conservation, 
                    these efforts contribute to the protection of these magnificent cats.
