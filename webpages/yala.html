                        The Indian Rock Python (Python molurus) is a large, non-venomous snake found in the Indian subcontinent, 
                        including Sri Lanka. With striking blotchy patterns on a background of tan or brown, it can grow over 5 
                        meters in length. A nocturnal constrictor, it preys on a variety of animals, employing its powerful coils 
                        to subdue and swallow its catch whole. Adapted to diverse habitats, from grasslands to forests, these pythons 
                        are crucial for ecosystem balance by controlling prey populations. Facing threats like habitat loss and poaching, 
                        conservation efforts are essential for preserving the Indian Rock Python's role in the intricate web of its native 
                        ecosystems.
